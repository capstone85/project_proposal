# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Adriana Morales, Cynthia Delira, Michelle Fox-Romero, Monica Kirabo**

## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.
Problem statement: Many people find difficulty in looking for specific clothing items and must travel from shop to shop, either online or in person, just to see what kinds of things are in store. An upward trend in fast fashion purchases has also increased environmental and energy costs due to long shipping times and wasteful packaging. Our application seeks to allow people looking for clothing in one centralized place and give local clothing shops a platform to reduce time and energy costs and make shopping for clothing more convenient.

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project?

What are the key features your site has to offer its users? 

How will your targeted audience use your website?

1. We want customers to be able to shop for clothing in one, centralized place.
  * Problems we are trying to solve in this vision:
    i. Customers do not want to jump from app to app
    ii. A lot of time and energy spent (shopping and shipping) 
    iii. Customers make multiple payments in separate stores (entering credit card info multiple times)
    iv. Customers have to track multiple problems in multiple places
2. We want to give both local and national clothing stores an online platform to increase their revenue.
  * Problems we are trying to solve:
    i. Local stores don’t have much traction or a platform for their stores to compete with big clothing companies. 
3. Sustainability (for seller, buyer): We want to have time- and cost-efficient shipping for customers and vendors alike.
  * Problems we are trying to solve in this vision: 
    i. Significant, separate shipping costs involved in placing an order.
    ii. Environmental cost of shipping includes gas mileage
    iii. Cardboard and plastic waste involved in packaging

## Related Work

What are some similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

Similar apps: Uber Eats, Instacart, Amazon Prime/Fresh. Our project focuses on clothing specifically.

Our project stands out from these websites since its purpose is for clothing and allows for small businesses and small retail stores that have a lack of online presence to expand their customers.

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?
* We are still unsure about how to connect the vendor with the user side 
* We will need to research how to implement a secure transaction feature (tentatively)
* We will need to research how to implent vendor-exclusive features (tentatively)
* We will need to research how to display order tracker and location (tentatively)
